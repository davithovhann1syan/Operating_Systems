Assignment 1: Fixed-Length File Processing
Objective:
Write a C program that processes a file (file1.txt) with fixed-length lines (10 characters each). The program will read the content line by line, reverse each line, and write the reversed lines into another file (file2.txt).
________________________________________
Requirements:
1.	File Format:
	* Each line in file1.txt is exactly 10 characters.
	* If a line is shorter, it is padded with spaces to reach 10 characters.
2.	Operations to Use:
	* creat, open, close, read, write
3.	Steps:
	1. Create and write a file (file1.txt) with user input.
	2. Ensure each line is padded to 10 characters.
	3. Open file1.txt and read it line by line (10 bytes at a time).
	4. Reverse each 10-character line.
	5. Write the reversed lines to another file (file2.txt).
________________________________________
Example
Input (file1.txt):
Hello     
World     
Programming

Output (file2.txt):
olleH
dlroW
gnimmargorP

Assignment 2: Synchronizing Parallel Histogram Updates
Objective

Write a C program to demonstrate a critical section problem where multiple threads build a shared histogram (array of 10 counters). 
Then synchronize the threads using:
 - POSIX spin locks
 - POSIX mutexes
 - POSIX semaphores

Problem Description
You will compute a histogram of digits from 0 to 9.
 - The program creates an integer array data[] of size N=1000000.
 - It fills data[i] = i % 10; so the distribution is perfectly uniform and the expected histogram is known.
 - Several threads process different parts of data[] in parallel and update a shared global hist[10] array.

Without synchronization, updates to hist[] cause race conditions and wrong counts.

Then you will fix it using:
 - spin lock,
 - mutex,
 - semaphore (binary).

Requirements

Global data

#define N 1000000
#define NUM_THREADS 4
int data[N];
int hist[10] = {0};
data[] holds digits 0–9.

hist[d] counts how many times digit d appears.

Initialization

In main:

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    data[i] = i % 10;
}


Expected histogram (since N is divisible by 10):

hist[0] = hist[1] = ... = hist[9] = N / 10;


Thread work

Split the array into NUM_THREADS segments.

Each thread gets start and end indexes.

For each i in its segment:

int d = data[i];          // between 0 and 9
hist[d]++;                // CRITICAL SECTION


Output:
After all threads have finished, print the histogram and compare against the expected value:

Mode 0 (no sync):
hist[0] = 99872   (expected 100000)
hist[1] = 100031
...

Mode 2 (synced with ...):
hist[0] = 100000  (expected 100000)
...
hist[9] = 100000  (expected 100000)
