Part 1: Process Creation, Pointers |
-----------------------------------|
Step 1: Fork and Exec
Task: Write a C program where:

	The parent process:
	 - Declares a character array (e.g., char str[] = "Hello";).
	 - Creates a pointer to char that points to the second element of the array.
	 - Prints pointer’s address, pointers value(address of the char) and the value stored at the address pointed by the pointer.
	 - Creates a child process.
	 - Waits for the child process to complete using wait() and checks the exit status.

	The child process:
	 - Executes a separate program written in Step 2.

	Specific Requirements:	
	 Parent prints the following before forking:
	 - The pointer's address: "Pointer's address: X."
	 - The value stored in the pointer: "Pointer value: Y."
	 - The value of a char using pointer dereferencing: "Char value: Z."
	 - After forking, parent waits for the child to finish and prints: "Parent PID: X, waiting for child."
	 - Child prints: "Executing child program."
	 - In the parent process you should handle potential errors of fork and exec calls.

Step 2: Child Process - Array Management Program
	Task: Write a separate C program (child.c) that:
	 - Creates an array of 100 integers.
	 - Fills the array with values from 0 to 99 using array name as a pointer.
	 - Defines a function triple(int *arr, int size) which receives array pointer and array size as arguments and triples the value of each element. Pay attention that the function should modify the actual array.
	 - Calls triple() function. 
	 - Prints the first 5 and last 5 elements of the array using array name as a pointer. The values should be updated (x3).
	
	Parent Process After Child Execution:
	 - After the child completes execution, the parent process should modify the value pointed to by the original pointer and print the updated value.

Part 2: Compilation Stages and Binary Analysis |
-----------------------------------------------|
Step 1: Prepare report.txt file where you should put the required comments for the each stage.
Step 2: Compilation Stages and Symbol Inspection with nm
	Task: Compile the child array management program and inspect the symbol tables using nm.

	Stage 1: Preprocess the code using gcc. You should get child.i file at the output of this stage.
	Action: Open the preprocessed file and briefly observe the code. In report.txt file explain what is the output of preporcessing stage.

	Stage 2: Compile the program to an object file using gcc.
	Action: Use nm to analyze the object file.
	Investigation: Identify and explain key symbols like main, triple and external functions like printf, which should be undefined at this stage.
	Key Task: List which symbols are defined and which are undefined. Include the results of investigation and a short explanation in report.txt file.
	
	Stage 3: Link the object file to create an executable.
	Action: Use nm to inspect the final executable.
	Investigation: Compare the symbols in the object file with those in the executable.
	Identify previously undefined symbols (e.g., printf) that are now resolved.

	Deliverable: In the report, you should:
	Include outputs from nm on both the object file and the final executable.
	Provide a comparison of the symbol tables, particularly highlighting how undefined symbols in the object file are resolved in the executable.
	Summarize the role of linking in resolving external symbols, with a focus on how symbols evolve through the compilation process.

	Specific Requirements:
	 - You must use the appropriate commands to preprocess, compile, and link the program.
	 - Compare the results of nm on the object file and the executable.
	 - Write a brief explanation of how symbols transition from being undefined in the object file to resolved in the final executable.

Step 3: Analyze the ELF Header with readelf
	Task: Use readelf to inspect the ELF header of your compiled executable.
	Action: Run the appropriate readelf command to display the ELF header information.
	Deliverable:
	Copy the relevant ELF header data into report.txt.
	Key Task: Identify and note the entry point address of your program. This address indicates where execution begins in your compiled binary.

Step 4: Trace Function Calls with objdump
	Task: Utilize objdump to trace how the main function is invoked and followed throughout the program execution.
	Action: Run the necessary objdump command to generate the disassembly of your executable.
	Deliverable:
	In report.txt, include an explanation of how the entry point is utilized during program execution.
	List the addresses and corresponding function names for all functions that are called, starting from the entry point up to and including main.
	Key Task: Depict the chain of function calls with their addresses in a clear format, showing how control flows from the entry point to main.
